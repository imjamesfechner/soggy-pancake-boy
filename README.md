# soggy-pancake-boy
A C implementation of the pancake sort problem, specifically the burnt pancake problem.
Given a stack of burnt pancakes of a chosen height, this algorithm will sort the stack by ascending size, with all pancakes burnt side down. A negative number for the size indicates burnt side up, while a positive number indicates burnt side down.
